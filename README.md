# uncertainty-estimation

## First Part

In this practical we review principles of modelling uncertainty and then implement a simple deep network on a toy regression task that can learn to estimate predictive uncertainty of both aleatoric and epistemic kinds. The epistemic uncertainty is modelled using variational approximation with simple posterior assumptions on network weights.  

## Second Part

In this practical, we study two simple yet effective ensembling methods for uncertainty estimation. In the first practical, we have a look at the state-of-the-art Deep Ensembles method. In the second part, we have a look at a follow-up paper that tries to address some of its limitations.
